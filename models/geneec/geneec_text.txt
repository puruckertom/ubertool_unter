<p>GENEEC is a screening-level aquatic exposure assessment model used in the 
determination of the ecological risk assessment process. It works in conjunction 
with other environmental fate and transport models such as the Pesticide Root Zone 
Model (PRZM) and the Exposure Analysis Modeling System (EXAMS). GENEEC is used to 
establish which chemicals were most likely to pose a higher risk and should be 
assessed. The chemicals that GENEEC finds to be further assessed are then used in the
labor-intensive and time consuming PRZM and EXAMS models.</p>
<p>GENEEC was designed to mimic a much more sophisticated PRZM/EXAMS simulation.
However, GENEEC requires only a few, readily available input parameters, which 
makes it fast and easy to use.</p>
