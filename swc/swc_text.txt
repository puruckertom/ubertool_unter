<p>The Surface Water Calculator (SWC) estimates pesticide concentrations in water bodies that result from pesticide applications to land.  The calculator SWC was designed for regulatory applications, as applied in the USEPA Office of Pesticides (OPP) as well as PMRA Health Canada.  The calculator SWC uses PRZM (version 5.0+) and the Variable Volume Water Body Model (VVWM), a replacement for the older EXAMS model.</p>
